# Kamry Bowman Portfolio Site

Repository for my portfolio site, built using NextJS for server-side routing, and Styled-Components for styling. Overall the side was built to ensure accessibility across devices, and CSS based animation solutions were chosed within the Styled-Component delivery choice. SSR was chose to ensure that the site could be indexed by search engines and would function in browsers without javascript beign enabled.

The site was deployed uisng Now by Zeit. Now was excellent to work with, and I would recommend it.
